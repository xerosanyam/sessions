- why python server?

- generic vs simpleHTTPServer
  server types
  simple
  - serves html, css, js
  - also called static server
  - very cheap - free, storage(ssd, hdd)
  - dynamic
  - Java, Javascript(node), python
  - tomcat(pure server)
  - costly - 500Rs, directly related to computing
- frameworks
  - django(opinionated - routing)
- what is render?
- js

  - browser, events
  - api call
  - node
  - scripting, no compilation required, dynamic
  - not related java at all
  - single thread
  - sequential vs non blocking

    - sequential - read program from top
    - non blocking - able to perform async operation without blocking further
    - // pros
      // - able to build faster
      // - no types

    // con
    // - errors occur at run time
    // - more testing needed

- java
  - compliation -> one time X
  - blocking
    - for non blocking -> Threads
- html
  - tags, powerful
  - important semantically
  - seo
- css

  - styling

- can we manipulate html/css using python/java?

### Browser

- Program
- Environment, DOM
- renders html, css, js -> builds a Tree

### Threads

- OS level, makes use of multi-threaded processor
- cpu,processor -1
- cores - multiple

- Single Program (No OS)
- Multiple Program
  - Most time is spent on IO, & cpu is free
  - OS, manages process
    - Os runs program on 1 cpu
    - multiple cores, OS can core

Core -> Threads -> Browser-> JS


### why are there so many webpage making technologies?

### nodejs

### Library
- collection of functions
### framework
- collection of libraries

### css specificity
- inline style
- internal css
- external css
- id, class
- tag

## Vanilla JS
### JQUERY
### Vue, React

- manipulating dom is expensive
- state
- event driven -> state driven


## Editors
### Monaco
### Prosemirror

## Docker
## CSS frameworks
